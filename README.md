# Stable-Matching-games-calculator
This is a python based application which can find a stable matching for a bipartite matching problem similar to that of the stable marriage problem except payoffs are determined by strategic games between matched players and both sides of the matching can choose a potential partner instead of just one like in the Gale Shapley Algorithm.
